This page was written using **markdown** and it _works_!

> ðŸš€ **NOTE: This is a test website** I made to help my friend Jim get started writing articles using Markdown and GitHub Pages

### Source Code 
* [https://github.com/swharden/swharden.github.io](https://github.com/swharden/swharden.github.io)

### First Steps
* Review [these core concepts](concepts)
* Write some articles

### Eventually (optional)
* Get a domain name
* Get the Jekyll build running locally
* Move hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify
* Consider an alternative [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators)
