This page is `index.md`. 

It uses **markdown** and it _works_!

I made this page as a test before working with Jim.

### Next Steps
* Review [these core concepts](concepts)
* Write some articles

### Eventually (optional)
* Get a domain name
* Get the Jekyll build running locally
* Move hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify
* Consider an alternative [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators)
