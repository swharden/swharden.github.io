This page is `index.md`. 

It uses **markdown** and it _works_!

I made this page as a test before working with Jim.

### Next Steps

1) Review [these core concepts](./concepts)
2) Write some articles

### Eventually (optional)
4) Get a domain name
5) Get the Jekyll build running locally
6) Move hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify
7) Consider an alternative [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators)
